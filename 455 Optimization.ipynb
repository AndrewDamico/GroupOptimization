    "**Problem:** A class has 11 students which need to be placed into 4 groups with a minimum number of 2 students per group and a maximum number of 3 students per group. Each group should be assigned a unique topic out of a list of 8 possible topics. Students may rank their topic preference with 1 being the most desirable topic and 8 being the least desireable topic and these rankings will be taken into account when creating the groups.\n",

    "* finance\n",

    "**Solution:** We can set this problem up as a constrained optimization problem where we are trying to minimize the objective function. Each of the 4 teams has a 'weight' which is the sum of the weights that the students on the team proscribed to the topic assigned to that team... our goal is to minimize the sum of the weights accross all teams. Our constraints are that each team have a minimum and maximum number of team members, that each team member can only be on 1 team, and that only 4 teams/topics can be created."
